title: Send a test message
---

Open a Python command prompt window - this is different than the standard Windows Command Prompt!
[screenshot of Python window]

Paste the following test messages into the Python window:

`import telegram_send` and press Enter.

`telegram_send.send(messages=["Wow that was easy!"])`

Press Enter again and you should see "Wow that was easy!" pop up as a message in the Telegram app.

Python is now configured to send messages to Telegram.
