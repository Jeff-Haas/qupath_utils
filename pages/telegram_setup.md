title: Telegram Messenger computer setup
---

- Install Telegram on your computer, and log into your account.

[Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/)
<br/>

- Now, configure Telegram - this step is easier on the computer:<br/>
Click this link to access the Telegram "BotFather", which is their utility to configure automatic responses, or "bots":

[BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)

It will open Telegram on your computer directly to the BotFather account.
<br/>

- Send the message: <br> 
`/newbot` <br/>
to BotFather by clicking Start at the bottom of the window, and follow the instructions that come back.  

You will answer two questions (naming your bot) and then it will display a bunch of text.  I suggest you copy the block of text into a document and save it, it has your token to access the Telegram API.

You've set up your Telegram account and added an auto-responding "bot" to it.  Any message sent to your new bot will show up both in the app on your computer and on your phone.  You don't need to have the version on your computer running, you can just have the app on your phone.
