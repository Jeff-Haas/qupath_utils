- Install Telegram on your computer and set up an account.

[Telegram Messenger] (https://telegram.org/)

- Configure Telegram
Click this link to access the Telegram "BotFather", which is their utility to configure automatic responses, or "bots":

[BotFather] (https://telegram.me/BotFather)

It will open Telegram on your computer, to the BotFather account.

- Send the message `/newbot` (no quotes) to BotFather by clicking Start at the bottom of the window, and follow the instructions that come back.  

You will answer two questions (naming your bot) and then it will display a bunch of text.  I suggest you copy the block of text into a document and save it, it has your token to access the Telegram API.

You've set up your Telegram account and added an auto-responding "bot" to it.
